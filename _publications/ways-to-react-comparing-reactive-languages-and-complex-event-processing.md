name: "Ways to React: Comparing Reactive Languages and Complex Event Processing"
abstract: "Reactive applications demand for detecting the changes that occur in a domain of interest and for timely reactions. Examples range from simple interactive applications to complex monitoring tasks involving distributed and heterogeneous systems. Over the last years, different programming paradigms and solutions have been proposed to support such applications. In this paper, we focus on two prominent approaches: event-based programming, specifically Complex Event Processing (CEP), and Reactive Languages (RLs). CEP systems enable the definition of high level situations of interest from low level primitive events detected in the external environment. On the other hand, RLs support time-changing values and their composition as dedicated language abstractions. These research fields have been investigated by different communities, belonging respectively to the database and the distributed systems areas and to the programming language area. It is our belief that a deeper understanding of these research fields, including their benefits and limitations, their similarities and differences, could drive further developments in supporting reactive applications. For this reason, we propose a first comparison of the two fields. Despite huge differences, we believe that such a comparison can trigger an interesting discussion across the communities, favor knowledge sharing, and let new ideas emerge."
