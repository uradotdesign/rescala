name: "Reactive Programming: a Walkthrough"
abstract: "Over the last few years, Reactive Programming has emerged as the trend to support the development of reactive software through dedicated programming abstractions. Reactive Programming has been increasingly investigated in the programming languages community and it is now gaining the interest of practitioners. Conversely, it has received so far less attention from the software engineering community. This technical briefing bridges this gap through an accurate overview of Reactive Programming, discussing the available frameworks and outlining open research challenges with an emphasis on cross-field research opportunities."
